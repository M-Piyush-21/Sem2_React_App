# Sem2_React_App

E-commerce Product Page made using React JS with the functionalities to add a product, view a product, edit the details of a product, and delete a product.

It utilises useEffect, useState hooks from react library; BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link, useNavigate, useParams hooks from react-router-dom library, 


Hooks are functions that allow us to access the features of React.

- useState hook allow us to create and manage state variables whose values once changed, trigger a component rerender. They retain their value even after a component rerenders. It consists of the state variables and a setter function to set their values.
- useEffect hook allows us to execute some particular functions after a change in the component's lifecycle. It consists of the code to execute and an array of dependencies, which consists of elements whose values once changed, will call the useEffect hook.
- BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route hooks allow us to use routing features of React which help us to load different components on different links(or routes).
- Link tag is used to programatically navigate from one page to another without reloading the entire page or component, unlike <a> tags which reload the entire webpage on click, and hence are efficient.
- useParams is used to extract variables from the URL link of a webpage and allow us to display customisable content based on the variables stored in the URL path or link.
- useNavigate is used to navigate to other components and is used inside functions or other hooks.
